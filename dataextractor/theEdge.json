Its quarterly net profit leapt to RM5.39 million from RM4.31 million previously, riding on the back of an uptrend in gold prices.\nHowever, quarterly revenue came in a marginal 1.7% lower at RM236.37 million compared with RM240.44 million a year ago, due to softer demand for gold jewellery products, according to its exchange filing this evening.\nFor the cumulative nine-month period (9MFY19), Poh Kong recorded a net profit of RM15.31 million, up 5.7% from RM14.48 million in the same period a year ago, while revenue grew 5.1% to RM768.65 million from RM731.35 million in 9MFY18.\nPoh Kong said although retail sentiment still remains soft due to cautious consumer spending, the group is confident of its resilience to weather the challenges ahead for its financial year ending July 31, 2019.\n\u201cThe group is positive that the demand for gold-related products will remain resilient and provide investors with a complementary investment option while at the same time, is a liquid asset and a safe haven during economic uncertainties,\u201d it added.\nShares in Poh Kong closed 1.5 sen or 3.06% higher today at 50.5 sen, bringing it a market capitalisation of RM207.22 million.\n","10":"KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): The Cement and Concrete Association of Malaysia (C&CA) said the price of cement is not driving house prices up, pointing to the Malaysian House Price Index (MHPI) which shows that the price of property had climbed between 2016 and 2018 despite a declining trend in the price of the raw material during that period.\nThe association issued a statement today to address concerns raised on the potential impact of the announced net cement price adjustment on the construction industry and house prices, if implemented.\n\u201cAccording to the MHPI, published by the Ministry of Finance;s National Property Information Centre (NAPIC), house prices in Malaysia have increased by 13% between 1Q2016 and 4Q 2018 against declining cement prices as shown in the charts below.\n\u201cMany cement-related building materials have not shown much decline in their prices despite cement prices deteriorating significantly. This means the fluctuation of cement prices does not correlate with many of such building material prices,\u201d it said.\nC&CA further said that the net cement price adjustment by companies is merely to restore prices to levels that allow the companies to survive.\nWhile there are no restrictions on cement imports, the association said it does not see any influx of cement importation into the country, given that the local prices in Malaysia are among the lowest in the region.\nIt pointed out that Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (MDTCA) officers have visited all cement plants and issued notices to collect information relating to reasons for the announcements of net cement price adjustments.\n\u201cThe eventual findings will show that net cement prices have been on a decline and reaching levels that are lower than total operating costs and depreciation,\u201d it said.\nThe association said the combination of lower cement prices and higher operating costs have resulted in its member companies suffering significant losses, highlighting the quarterly weak results registered by Lafarge Malaysia Bhd, HUME Industries Bhd and Tasek Corp Bhd since 1Q2017.\n\u201cCollectively, the above companies have incurred losses close to RM1 billion over nine quarters. As a result, cement companies were forced to take the necessary actions to lower their operating costs by mothballing kiln lines, cutting staff benefits and significant retrenchments.\n\u201cIf this situation persists, we fear that there will be an adverse impact on the country\u2019s GDP and thousands of jobs, direct and indirect, will be at risk,\u201d said C&CA.\nMeanwhile, the association said it has always been supportive of the Government\u2019s affordable housing efforts, adding that it is always willing to assist the Government in achieving its vision of affordable housing with a special pricing scheme on cement.\nIt highlighted that this was previously done in the 1980s to assist in the construction of concrete roads, which made up 30% of the North-South Expressway.\n\u201cAs the cement industry has an important role to play in the continued development of the nation, we have and will continue to support and assist the Government and the rakyat in our country\u2019s future success,\u201d it said.\n","11":"KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): Transmile Group Bhd\u2019s founder and former chief executive officer Gan Boon Aun claimed that the chief financial officer Lo Chok Ping had confessed that he had overstated the air cargo operator\u2019s revenue for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2006 (FY06) in a private meeting between the two on May 8, 2007.\nAnd Lo requested Gan to call for a board meeting the next day.\nThe private meeting happened four days after the board was informed by the company\u2019s external auditor Deloitte & Touches that they were not able to have relevant supporting documentation from the management on certain transactions relating to trade receivables and related sales.\nTransmile told Bursa Malaysia on May 7, 2007, that the board has concerns as to the reliability of the unaudited consolidated results that were released on Feb 15, 2007 after it received a letter dated May 4, 2007, from Deloitte & Touches.\nIn short, Gan claimed that he did not know about the cause of the accounting irregularities until Lo confessed to him.\nLo was also charged with abetting the company in making a misleading statement to Bursa Malaysia. The Securities Commission (SC) withdrew the charge against Lo in May 2008, after he paid a compound of RM700,000.\nIn the cross-examination by deputy public prosecutor Mohd Hafiz Mohd Yusof today, Gan said that the private meeting with the CFO was when he found out for the first time how the accounting irregularities had happened in Transmile\u2019s FY06 accounts. \u00a0\nGan said he did not reveal Lo\u2019s confession to any of the board members until the board meeting was held on May 9, the day after the private meeting. Lo confessed to the board members his wrongdoing at the meeting. \u00a0\nHafiz asked Gan why he as the CEO allowed Lo to take long leave between March and May 2007 during the critical time when Transmile needed to iron out the accounting issues.\n\u201cHe told me he had some family problems (to settle),\u201d Gan replied.\nIt was also revealed that Lo had met with external auditors Deloitte & Touche before the board meeting on Feb 15, which was the day the unaudited accounts for FY06 were filed with Bursa Malaysia. The details of Lo\u2019s meeting with auditors was not disclosed.\nIn July 2007, Gan, Lo, and former executive director Khiudin Mohamed were charged with abetting the company in making a misleading statement to Bursa Malaysia in its quarterly report. The trio had claimed trial.\nThe Securities Commission withdrew the charge against Lo in May 2008, after he paid a compound of RM700,000, while Khiudin was acquitted from the charge in 2016.\nThe charge was related to a statement on the group's revenue of RM338.4 million for 4QFY06 and RM989 million for the whole FY06. However, a special audit revealed the company only earned revenue of RM656 million for the full year and suffered an annual loss of RM126 million.\nIn 2006, its losses were RM126.3 million instead of a profit of RM157.5 million and in 2005, Transmile\u2019s losses were RM369.6 million instead of a profit of RM84.4 million as reported.\nAfter a tumultuous chain of events, Transmile was categorised as Practice Note 17 company in 2010, and was then suspended and delisted from Bursa in 2011.\nThe court proceedings for the Transmile accounting scandal was adjourned by Sessions Judge Hasbullah Adam today, and will be continued on Oct 22 and 23.\n","12":"KUALA LUMPUR: SRC International Sdn Bhd has spent more than 90% of the two loans totalling RM4 billion granted to it by Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) (KWAP) in 2014, says former SRC director Datuk Suboh Mohd Yassin.\nHe said the government-guaranteed loans were spent across \u201cmultiple investments\u201d.\n\u201cThe remaining RM400 million is stored in SRC\u2019s bank account for operating expenditure and domestic investment,\u201d Suboh, who was testifying in the corruption trial of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, told High Court judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali today.\nOut of the RM400 million, RM40 million was used for property investment in Bukit Jalil here, which was later sold to SRC's subsidiary Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd for RM65 million. Suboh is also a former director of Gandingan Mentari.\nSuboh was the prosecution's 42nd witness in the on-going trial.\nOn another matter, Suboh said SRC had appointed Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd via a letter in 2014 to conduct corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes such as poverty eradication and assistance to East Coast flood victims.\nFollowing the appointment, Suboh said SRC directors had signed off a RM250 million grant to fund Ihsan Perdana\u2019s CSR initiatives.\u00a0\nEarlier in May, however, Ihsan Perdana managing director Datuk Dr Shamsul Anwar Sulaiman \u2013 the 37th prosecution witness \u2013 told the court that \u201cIhsan Perdana did not receive the funds amounting to RM250 million from SRC as stated in the appointment letter\u201d.\nSuboh has indicated to the court today that the recommendation for SRC to conduct CSR initiatives came from former SRC CEO Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil who is now on the run from authorities. Similarly, Nik Faisal was also the one who had proposed a mediating company \u2014 later identified as Ihsan Perdana \u2014 to be appointed as the entity to undertake the CSR initiatives.\u00a0\nSuboh, who is also a signatory for Gandingan Mentari\u2019s bank accounts alongside Nik Faisal, earlier told the court that he ditched a voluntary visit to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and left Malaysia in the heat of the SRC and 1MDB expos\u00e9 in 2015 for fear of his safety.\u00a0\n\u201cI was told during the call that the SRC matters involved Datuk Seri Najib [who was still prime minister at the time],\u201d he said, when asked by prosecution during his examination-in-chief the reason he was scared at the time.\nAfter the 14th general election last year, the 68-year-old Suboh said he had received a call from Nik Faisal to again flee Malaysia to avoid investigation, a directive he said he did not follow.\nNajib is currently facing seven criminal charges for allegedly receiving RM42 million from SRC into his account as a token for facilitating the two KWAP loans of RM2 billion. The trial will enter its 30th day on July 1.\n","13":"JAKARTA (June 20): Indonesia's central bank held its policy interest rate unchanged on Thursday, but moved to cut the reserve requirement for banks and said it was now appeared a \"matter of timing and magnitude\" before it made its first cut in rates since September of 2017.\nBank Indonesia (BI) left its 7-day reverse repurchase rate at 6.00%, in line with the expectations of 19 out of 22 analysts surveyed by Reuters.\nGovernor Perry Warjiyo said BI would from July lower the reserve requirement for banks by 50 basis points to boost liquidity. The decision came hours after the Federal Reserve said it was ready to battle growing global and domestic economic risks with interest rate cuts beginning as early as next month.\nThe Bank of Japan later joined the Fed in signalling readiness to ramp up stimulus.\nDovish signals coming from the world's major central banks, along with rate cuts in other emerging market economies heightened expectations that Indonesia will join a global switch to an easier monetary policy.\nSoutheast Asia's biggest economy missed market forecasts for its economic growth in the first quarter due to cooling investment, boosting the case for a rate cut to begin unwinding last year's tightening.\nCentral banks in India, Malaysia and the Philippines have all cut rates this year to boost growth. But like Indonesia, the Philippine held its benchmark rate steady on Thursday while also saying there was room to ease.\nBank Indonesia's Warjiyo said: \"we have conveyed that we are monitoring two things - global financial market conditions and balance of payments \u2014 in considering rate cuts.\"\n\"So cutting rates is an action that we will take in the future. It is a matter of time and magnitude,\" he told BI's monthly policy meeting, adding the main issue currently impacting global markets was the US-China trade war.\nTaiwan's central bank also kept policy rate unchanged, but lowered its 2019 GDP growth outlook amid worries the trade war will hurt its economy.\nIndonesia's rupiah currency edged up a fraction after the rate announcement, while the main stock index briefly firmed before ending the day 0.1% down from previous closing.\nLast year, between May and November, BI raised the benchmark six times by a total of 175 basis points to support the rupiah in the wake of US rate hikes by the Fed.\nBI's baseline scenario expects the Fed to make no rate moves this year, Warjiyo said, but he sees a possibility of up to 75 bps cut in US interest rates through 2020 depending on how big the impact of the trade war is on the US economy.\nLIQUIDITY INJECTION\nWarjiyo said economic growth was currently on track to be below the midpoint of its 5.0%-5.4% outlook.\nHe said efforts were needed to support domestic consumption, noting the cut in reserve requirements would give the banking system 25 trillion rupiah (US$1.8 billion) of liquidity that they could use to lend to customers.\nAndry Asmoro, chief economist Bank Mandiri, said there now appeared to be room for BI to cut its benchmark by 25 bps in the third quarter, \"sooner than our previous expectation, which was in Q419.\"\nHe said this would hinge on relatively low and stable inflation, an improving domestic investment climate, a shrinking current account deficit and a stable rupiah.\nThe annual inflation rate accelerated in May to 3.32% on the back of Ramadan festivities spending, but was still comfortably within BI's 2.5%-4.5% target range.\nWarjiyo said BI still sees the current account deficit in a range of 2.5%-3% of GDP in 2019, smaller than 2018's 3% gap.\nThe current account deficit is a source of vulnerability for Indonesia because it relies on portfolio investment to fund it.\n(US$1 = 14,175.0000 rupiah)\n","14":"BENGALURU (June 20): Most Southeast Asian stock markets ended firmer on Thursday, as dovish comments from the US Federal Reserve boosted global equities, while regional central banks flagged similar moves toward looser monetary settings.\nThe Fed on Wednesday signalled interest rate cuts beginning as early as July, saying it was ready to battle growing global and domestic economic risks, in a marked shift in tone since its last policy meeting.\nThe commentary was widely seen as more dovish than expected, sending global stocks higher.\nSingapore shares, which were among the top boost in the region, extended gains into a third session. The city-state was buoyed by blue-chip stocks such as DBS Group Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings.\nLeading the gains in the region, Vietnam shares closed 1% firmer. Financials largely powered the index, with Vietnam Technological And Commercial Joint Stock Bank adding 2.5%.\nThai stocks ended 0.7% higher, underpinned by gains in energy shares, which soared after rising tensions in the Middle East sent oil prices spiking. PTT PCL climbed 1.6%, while PTT Exploration and Production PCL ended at its highest since April 26.\nMeanwhile, the Philippine central bank kept its benchmark interest rate steady on Thursday, but left the door open to further policy easing as global risks to growth increases and as policymakers expect inflation to slow more than previously expected.\nPhilippine stocks clawed back from early losses to end little changed ahead of the central bank's announcement.\nIndonesian stocks rebounded from early losses to settle flat after Bank Indonesia decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged, but moved to cut the reserve requirement for banks for the time being.\nMalaysian stocks ended higher, with electricity utility provider Tenaga Nasional being the top gainer, while tourist resort operator Genting Malaysia closed up 1.2%.\nSOUTHEAST ASIAN STOCK MARKETS\nChange on the day\n\nMarket\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCurrent\u00a0\u00a0 \nPrevious close\u00a0 \n% move\nSingapore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3314.51\u00a0\u00a0\n3288.17\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n0.80\nBangkok\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1717.82\u00a0\u00a0\n1705.98\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n0.69\nManila\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n8022.42\u00a0\u00a0\n8017.01\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n0.07\nJakarta\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6335.698\u00a0\n6339.262\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n-0.06\nKuala Lumpur\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1675.43\u00a0\u00a0\n1666.54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n0.53\nHo Chi Minh\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n959.18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n949.69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1.00\n\nChange so far in 2019\n\nMarket\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nCurrent\u00a0\u00a0 \nEnd 2018\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n% move\nSingapore\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3314.51\u00a0\u00a0\n3068.76\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n8.01\nBangkok\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1717.82\u00a0\u00a0\n1563.88\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n9.84\nManila\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n8022.42\u00a0\u00a0\n7,466.02\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7.45\nJakarta\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6335.698\u00a0\n6,194.50\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2.28\nKuala Lumpur\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1675.43\u00a0\u00a0\n1690.58\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n-0.90\nHo Chi Minh\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n959.18\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n892.54\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7.47\n\n","15":"JOHOR BARU (June 20): WCT Holdings Bhd and Hyatt Hotels Corp (Hyatt) has entered into a management agreement to develop a 200-room hotel in an integrated development that includes the largest regional mall in Johor, Paradigm Mall Johor Bahru.\nDubbed Hyatt Place Johor Bahru, the hotel will feature 200 guestrooms, a cafe, swimming pool, fitness centre, as well as more than 2,400 sq ft of meeting space.

He said, \u2018Datuk, (you) don\u2019t need to come. Just go away\u2019,\u201d Suboh said, adding that he could not recognise the voice and the person also did not introduce himself.\nHe said the man told him not to visit the MACC, and instead instructed him to leave Malaysia.\n\u201cDo you know (his) ethnicity?\u201d deputy public prosecutor Datuk Ishak Mohd Yusoff asked.\n\u201cHe spoke in Malay,\u201d Suboh replied.\nSuboh further admitted that he felt scared at the time as Najib was still in power. \u201cI did not know what will happen to me and my family and so, I ran away to Bangkok for about a month. I bore all the expenses in Bangkok myself,\u201d he added.\nIshak: Why did you say you were scared? Did he (Najib) threaten you?\nSuboh: I was told during the call by (former SRC CEO) Nik Faisal (Ariff Kamil ) that (all) SRC matters involve Datuk Seri Najib.\nIshak: Then, what happened in Bangkok?\nSuboh: I met with a Thai man who gave tickets for my wife and me to fly to Abu Dhabi. In Abu Dhabi, I was brought to a Hotel Rosewood and stayed there for about a week. All the costs for the flights and accommodation were taken care of for me, but I am not aware who bore the costs.\nAfter Abu Dhabi, Suboh took a flight back to Bangkok and returned to Malaysia. It was not stated by him when this took place.\n\u201cWhen I returned, Nik Faisal gave me a call and ordered me to once again leave Malaysia to avoid investigation. (But this time,) I decided not to run away and stayed in Malaysia to assist with the investigation,\u201d he said.\nWhen asked by Ishak when he had received the call from Nik Faisal, Suboh said it was some time after the election.\nHowever, he did not indicate whether he was referring to the 14th General Election (GE14) or a by-election.\nWhen met by reporters later, prosecutor Datuk V Sithambaram confirmed that Suboh was referring to GE14 on May 9 last year.\nIt is understood that the prosecution will ask Suboh further on this issue when trial resumes on July 1.\n","17":"\uff08\u5409\u9686\u576120\u65e5\u8baf\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u7684\u5916\u56f4\u56e0\u7d20\u7ee7\u7eed\u63d0\u632f\u5e02\u573a\u60c5\u7eea\uff0c\u9a6c\u80a1\u4eca\u65e5\u6536\u4e8e\u5168\u65e5\u6700\u9ad8\u76841675.43\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u6790\u5458\u4e0d\u6392\u9664\u5728\u5468\u672b\u524d\u5c06\u51fa\u73b0\u5957\u5229\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n\u95ed\u5e02\u65f6\uff0c\u5bcc\u65f6\u9686\u7efc\u6307\u626c8.89\u70b9\u62160.53%\u3002\n\u9a6c\u516d\u7532\u8bc1\u5238\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u7ba1\u5c39\u91d1\u80dc\u5411theedgemarkets.com\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7efc\u6307\u672c\u5468\u7684\u6da8\u52bf\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u60c5\u7eea\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e2d\u7f8e\u8d38\u6613\u8c08\u5224\u7684\u4e50\u89c2\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5df2\u8d85\u4e70\u3002\n\u201c\u968f\u7740\u8fd1\u671f\u8d70\u9ad8\uff0c\u9a6c\u80a1\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u975e\u5e38\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5468\u672b\u4e4b\u524d\uff08\u660e\u5929\uff09\u4f1a\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5957\u5229\u3002\u201d\n\u8def\u900f\u793e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4e9a\u6d32\u80a1\u5e02\u5468\u56db\u4e0a\u6da8\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\u7f8e\u5143\u4e0b\u8dcc\u3001\u5168\u7403\u516c\u503a\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u91cd\u632b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7f8e\u56fd10\u5e74\u671f\u516c\u503a\u6536\u76ca\u7387\u8dcc\u78342%\uff0c\u6b64\u524d\u7f8e\u56fd\u8054\u50a8\u5c40\uff08FED\uff09\u6697\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u7a0d\u665a\u964d\u606f\u3002\n\u65e5\u672c\u65e5\u7ecf\u6307\u6570\u626c0.6%\u3001\u9999\u6e2f\u6052\u751f\u6307\u6570\u53471.23%\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u97e9\u56fd\u9996\u5c14\u7efc\u5408\u6307\u6570\u65000.31%\u3002\n\u9a6c\u80a1\u5168\u65e5\u6210\u4ea4\u91cf\u670922\u4ebf7000\u4e07\u80a1\uff0c\u6210\u4ea4\u503c\u7ea6\u4e3a22\u4ebf8000\u4e07\u4ee4\u5409\u3002\n\u4e0a\u5347\u80a1\u8fbe468\u53ea\u3001\u4e0b\u8dcc\u80a1353\u53ea\uff0c\u53e6\u6709380\u53ea\u65e0\u8d77\u843d\u3002\n\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0a\u5347\u80a1\u5305\u62ec\u56fd\u5bb6\u80fd\u6e90\uff08Tenaga Nasional Bhd\uff09\u548c\u4e91\u5347\u63a7\u80a1\uff08Yinson Holdings Bhd\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u9999\u683c\u91cc\u62c9\uff08Shangri-La Hotels (M) Bhd\uff09\u8dcc\u5e45\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u68ee\u90a3\u7f8e\u79cd\u690d\uff08Sime Plantation Bhd\uff09\u3002\n\u9601\u4ee3\u79d1\u6280\uff08Greatech Technology Bhd\uff09\u4ea4\u6295\u51a0\u5168\u573a\uff0c\u8fbe1\u4ebf434\u4e07\u80a1\u6613\u624b\u3002\n\u00a0\n\uff08\u7f16\u8bd1\uff1a\u9648\u6167\u73ca\uff09\n","18":"BENGALURU (June 20): Emerging-market stocks rallied for a third straight day and currencies gained on Thursday, amid signs of progress in US-China trade talks and signals by major central banks that they will soon loosen monetary policy.\nThe MSCI index of developing-world stocks jumped 1.3% to its highest since early May. China's blue-chip index and Shanghai Composite index closed at eight-week highs.\nHong Kong-listed stocks were up over 1%.

Washington blamed Tehran for the tanker attacks. Iran denied any role.\nConcern about slowing economic growth and a US-China trade dispute has pulled oil lower in recent weeks. Brent reached a 2019 high of US$75 in April.\nAlso propelling oil higher on Thursday was a larger-than-expected decline in US crude inventories and the prospect of prolonged supply restraint by producer group OPEC and its allies.\nAfter swelling to near two-year highs, US crude stocks fell by 3.1 million barrels last week, compared with analyst expectations for a draw of 1.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia agreed this week to meet on July 1-2, ending a month of wrangling about the timing of the meeting.\nThe coalition known as OPEC+ will discuss whether to extend throughout 2019 a deal on cutting 1.2 million barrels per day of production. The deal expires at the end of this month.\nMomentum for an agreement appeared to be building as the United Arab Emirates' energy minister said extending the deal was \"logical and reasonable\".\n","21":"KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): The FBM KLCI closed at its intraday high of 1,675.43 points today as positive external factors continue to support market sentiment, but an analyst does not rule out profit taking activity tomorrow ahead of the weekend.\nAt market close, the benchmark index settled 8.89 points or 0.53% higher.\nWhen contacted, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Victor Wan told theedgemarkets.com that the increment in KLCI this week was largely sentiment-driven, and investors seem to have overbought amidst optimism over US-China trade talks.\n\"With the recent uptrend, Malaysian market is very much fairly valued now, maybe there will be some profit taking tomorrow before the weekend,\" he said.\nReuters reported that Asian stock markets rallied on Thursday while the US dollar dropped and global bond yields plunged, with the 10-year US yield falling below 2%, after the Federal Reserve signalled possible interest rate cuts later this year.\nJapan's Nikkei gained 0.6% today, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index went up 1.23%, and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.31%.\nIn Malaysia, total market trading volume was 2.27 billion, worth some RM2.28 billion.\nMarket breadth was positive, with 468 gainers versus 353 losers, while 380 counters remained unchanged.\nNotable gainers include Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Yinson Holdings Bhd, while Sime Darby Plantation Bhd was the second largest decliner, after Shangri-la Hotels (M) Bhd.\nGreatech Technology Bhd was the most actively traded counter with 104.34 million shares done.\n","22":"A lot has been said about the performance of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition in running the country. In fact, it is still being discussed and the jury is out on the verdict.\nBut how about the performance of PH at the state level? On the other hand, how has Barisan Nasional (BN) fared so far and how does it compare with the new government?\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not fair to compare the performance of state governments run by either side,\u201d says Dr Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.\nFor one, he says, this is because BN is left with \u201ca few economically not significant states to run and the people there are generally content with their not-so-plentiful lot\u201d.\nThus, BN will not have to perform a lot to keep their states going, according to Oh. He notes that these states no longer enjoy the advantage of federal incumbency \u2014 hence, they are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to delivery of various forms of governmental largesse.\nBN needs to live with that reality and work out its action plan fast, I would add, or they risk losing the remaining state administrations when the 15th general election comes around. As we know from the results of the 14th general election, BN held on to Perlis and Pahang only.\nSo far, not much has been reported on the two states. It could be a case of no news is good news or that people simply do not care. There is also not much attention on PAS-run Kelantan and Terengganu save for some controversies involving the ruling party and eyebrow-raising religious edicts.\nPH, on the other hand, says Oh, is running the powerhouse states \u2014 Penang and Selangor, for example \u2014 where people are more demanding on the administration, especially on the delivery of services and economic planning.\n\u201cSo, PH needs to work extra hard, compared with its BN counterpart \u2014 which is what it has been doing but often does not get the praise it deserves,\u201d he says.\nMy answer to the question on how Penang and Selangor are performing would be that both states are doing all right. Several political observers and media friends I have spoken to rate Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow and Selangor Menteri Besar Amirudin Shari from \u201cOK lah\u201d to \u201cdoing fine\u201d and \u201cnot bad\u201d.\nThat is the general opinion \u2014 some controversies, notwithstanding. In Penang, the undersea tunnel and Pan Island Link 1 highway, for instance. In Selangor, it is chiefly the water problem.\nChow and Amirudin have big shoes to fill \u2014 taking over from Lim Guan Eng and Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali respectively. No easy feat. But, on the other hand, both have the advantage of taking over administrations that are already put on track by their predecessors. They are not stepping into the unknown. That makes their tasks somewhat easier. And after all, Penang and Selangor were won by the then Pakatan Rakyat coalition in the 2008 general election.\nThe other states run by PH are relatively quiet, giving the impression that either things are running smoothly or there are indeed issues and controversies that have not warranted national attention. Which is not to say that all is fine and dandy. In fact, there are PH states hogging the headlines for the wrong reasons.\nSome of the menteris besar have attracted and are still attracting negative vibes with their statements, actions and even non-action.\nGenerally, says Oh, the new MBs and executive council members are full of enthusiasm but lack administrative experience, being in the opposition previously. \u201cHence, there are a lot of gaffes with incumbent politicians making seemingly well-intentioned but, ultimately, impractical policy pronouncements only to retract them shortly after.\u201d\nAnd this, he says, creates an unprofessional image in the minds of increasingly discerning and demanding voters.\nMBs of the PH administrations have their share of issues and controversies.\nOne was Datuk Osman Sapian, who eventually resigned as menteri besar of Johor. It was said that his inaction on issues in the state had irked Putrajaya and the Johor palace. To date, it is still not clear if his resignation was the result of pressure from Putrajaya or the Johor palace, or both.\nThings in Johor are rather quiet now. That speaks well for Datuk Sahruddin Jamal, who took over from Osman as MB. Long story short, Sahruddin has got a tremendous task of striking a balance on appeasing both Putrajaya and the Johor palace.\nThen, there is Perak MB Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu and the uneasy state of affairs in his administration.\nIn a recent article, Malaysiakini columnist Mariam Mokhtar said Perak is a mess because of poor leadership, with the MB trying to outdo Umno Baru.\nShe opined that while Faizal might have the royal consent to be MB, the backing of the PH leadership and big business leaders \u201csucking up\u201d to him, he does not have the support of the people of Perak.\nWhether the columnist is right or wrong depends on who you ask. But at least one PH insider tells me that Perak is in danger as promises to the rakyat have not been fulfilled and Umno and PAS are stronger here than in other states.\nWhile one may agree that the state governments and the federal government need more time to deliver their electoral promises as they took office only a year ago, any wrong must be made right fast as the rakyat can be unforgiving.\nIn politics, as in life, complacency is a dirty word. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n","23":"PETALING JAYA (June 20): Malaysia's largest home improvement retailer, Mr DIY Group Sdn Bhd remains tight-lipped over its plan to launch an initial public offering (IPO) this year.\nIts managing director Adrian Ong declined to comment on news reports earlier this year which claimed that the company was planning to launch an IPO that could raise between RM1.5 billion and RM2.1 billion by the fourth quarter of this year.\nHowever, he said the company would continue its aggressive expansion strategy, adding that it had opened over 100 stores annually in the past two years.\n\"We feel that we should continue this pace, at least for the foreseeable future,\" he told reporters at the opening of the company's 500th store here today.\nHe said the company also strived for efficiency to remain competitive.\nLast year, Mr DIY recorded a net profit of RM300 million and a revenue of RM1.8 billion.\nThe company serves more than seven million customers monthly through their stores and online platform.\n","24":"KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): Malaysia appreciates the presentation by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) on Wednesday of the latest report on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 which was shot down five years ago and killed everyone on board.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement issued on Thursday, said Malaysia remains committed to the JIT process and are equally committed to ensuring that the process is transparent, credible and effective.\n\u201cOur approach has always been that conclusions must be based on evidence, and not be politically motivated.

The Reuters poll had pointed to growth of 2.7%.\nThe second consecutive monthly slide in retail sales does not bode well for overall growth in the second quarter for an economy which is struggling with Britain\u2019s Brexit crisis as well as a slowdown in growth globally.\nOfficial data has shown the economy contracted sharply in April, adding to reasons why the Bank of England is likely to keep interest rates on hold when it announces its June policy decision at 1100 GMT.\nSterling and British government bonds showed little reaction to the retail sales data.\n\u201cAlthough earnings continue to outstrip inflation, a second stutter in as many months will serve as a stark reminder that the retail sector\u2019s recent growth should not be taken for granted,\u201d Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said.\nUntil now, consumers have largely taken Brexit in their stride, helped by stable inflation and stronger growth in wages.\nThat has helped the world\u2019s fifth-biggest economy at a time when many companies have been cutting back on investment because of uncertainty about Brexit.\nThe ONS said unseasonably cold weather hit demand for clothing and footwear sales, which fell 4.5% on the month \u2014 the biggest drop since July 2015.\n\u201cWe see quite a mixed picture across the rest of the sector as the decline in department store sales continued (in the three months to May), with no growth since September of last year,\u201d ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.\nUnderlining the squeeze on retailers\u2019 profit margins, sales in value terms rose only 2.7% in the year to May, the smallest rise in nearly three years.\nRetailers themselves have reported mixed fortunes of late.\nEarlier on Thursday, Dixons Carphone, Britain\u2019s biggest seller of electricals and mobile phones, reported a 22% fall in full-year profit, reflecting falling mobile sales in a tough market, and warned of another big decline in the current year.\nFashion brand Ted Baker this month reported an \u201cextremely difficult\u201d start to the year, although online fashion group Boohoo bucked a tough retail market with robust sales growth.\n","28":"PUTRAJAYA (June 20): Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali does not have to go on leave to facilitate the investigation into the viral controversial video implicating the Economic Affairs Minister.\nA minister should only take leave if the investigation is related to wrongdoing or crime, he said, adding that the case related to Mohamed Azmin is politically motivated.\n\"In fact, it is intended to embarrass him and to ask him to take leave.

All I can say is we try to stabilise our business and hope to achieve our targeted growth,\" he told reporters after the group's annual general meeting today.\nHe said growth in the current financial year ending Feb 29, 2020 (FY20) will be mainly driven by the personal, motorcycle and retail financing segment and the credit card segment.\nOne of Aeon Credit's key areas of focus in the current year is to consolidate its database \u2014 integrating its current five million loyalty card users to its new e-money card AEON Member Plus Visa Card and complementary wallet launched in 2018.\nThis will help the group expand its business via cross-selling activities and the introduction of other financial service products.\nUpon accumulating the members, the group intends to offer more value-added services through partnerships with companies in areas such as telecommunication, transportation or utilities, said the group's chief strategy officer Ajith Jayaram.\nMeanwhile, Aeon Credit will continue with its planned investments in areas such as IT infrastructure, financial technology (fintech) and digital solutions, as part of its RM150 million capital expenditure (capex) over the years from FY18 to FY20.\nThe group is also aiming to capture more middle 40% (M40) customers, to account for 40% of its portfolio in the next one to two years, from the current 35%, to optimise returns. The balance comes from the bottom 40% (B40) group.\nAt 4.15pm, Aeon Credit's share price was up six sen at RM16.60, bringing a market capitalisation of RM4.2 billion.\n","31":"KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): Former Cabinet deputy chief secretary Tan Sri Mazidah Abdul Majid told the High Court today that if Datuk Seri Najib Razak had received payment from SRC International Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MoF Inc), he would be required to declare his interests in Cabinet meetings discussing the company.\nMazidah, 70, who is the prosecution's 40th witness, said when the paper on SRC was presented to the Cabinet sometime in 2011 or 2012, it was immediately passed and there was no deliberation.\n\"There was no deliberation [on SRC] as if there [were] any, they would be reflected in the cabinet minutes,\" she said when replying to questions from Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk V Sithambaram.\nMazidah said if a minister had an interest in the matters to be brought up through the Cabinet memorandum, they would have to declare their interests and leave the meeting where the memorandum is tabled.\nShe cited two previous incidents where former Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin Abu Bakar and former Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein had left meetings after declaring their interests.\nThe meeting would continue after they excused themselves, she added.\nThrough Mazidah, the prosecution had showed that Najib had remained and even chaired Cabinet meetings discussing SRC's request for government guarantees to back its loan applications in Aug 2011 and Feb 2012.\nFrom other prosecution witnesses earlier, the prosecution had shown that the RM42 million from SRC \u2014 over which Najib is charged for criminal breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering \u2014 flowed from the company's subsidiaries Gandingan Mentari Sdn Bhd and Ihsan Perdana Sdn Bhd and into Najib's personal bank account.\nIshan Perdana Sdn Bhd's managing director Datuk Dr Shamsul Anwar had testified that he had transferred the sum in three tranches on Dec 26, 2014 and Feb 10, 2015 into the former premier's account.\nHe said that had he known the account belonged to Najib, he would not have made the transfers.\nDefence tried to show Dr M did not declare interests\nDuring Mazidah's cross-examination by senior lawyer Datuk Yusof Zainal Abiden, the witness said Najib had no blood ties with anyone in SRC, which was probably why the former prime minister did not leave the meeting.\nShe also did not know that Najib was the adviser emeritus for the company.\nMazidah added that usually, a person who has family links to the individuals involved in companies or projects discussed in Cabinet meetings would declare his or her interests and leave the cabinet meeting.\nThroughout her cross-examination, Najib's defence, led by Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee, tried to show that other prime ministers, especially Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, had not left Cabinet meetings or declared their interests in matters they deliberated on.\nThe defence cited several instances including the Bumiputera Bank scandal, the BMF Bank scandal, the deal involving Malaysian International Shipping Corporation's (MISC) purchase of shipping interests of Datuk Mirzan Mahathir in 1998 or Petronas matters.\nMazidah remembers that there was an occasion when Dr Mahathir had not excused himself from Cabinet meetings on an issue discussed related to Petronas, which falls under the purview of the Prime Minister's Office.\nShe, however, said that she cannot answer regarding the BMF or Bumiputera cases, as she was not Cabinet secretary then.\nThe witness served as Cabinet secretary for a long time \u2014 from Dr Mahathir's first tenure as prime minister in the 1990's, to Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi's premiership from 2004 to April 2009, and Najib from 2009 to May 9, 2018, before serving once more under Dr Mahathir from May 10, 2018 onwards.\n","32":"REFUGEES, who have no legal status in Malaysia, would have a net positive impact on the economy if they are given the right to work, a report by the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (IDEAS) shows.\n\u201cWe estimate that if refugees are given the right to work, their contribution to annual GDP would increase to over RM3 billion by 2024 through higher spending,\u201d says the report\u2019s lead author Laurence Todd.\nThere are currently 160,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in Malaysia, the majority from Myanmar. They form a relatively small portion of the immigrant population, both legal and undocumented, which is estimated at about six million, states the report, entitled \u201cThe economic impact of granting refugees in Malaysia the right to work\u201d.\nAs Malaysia has not ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention, refugees and asylum seekers cannot work legally and have very little access to proper healthcare and education.\nRefugees are people who have escaped persecution in their home countries, while migrants go abroad to look for work, raise their income levels or to seek a better life, Todd says in an interview with The Edge.\nContrary to public perception, the IDEAS report shows that refugees\u2019 negative impacts on labour markets are likely to be minor and limited to other foreign workers and older, less-educated Malaysians, he says.\n\u201cOverall, Malaysians would benefit if refugees were allowed to work as they would generate more jobs and contribute to higher wages for locals. Our study shows that they could create an addition 4,000 jobs for Malaysians,\u201d he says.\nThe wider economic impact, including indirect effects such as lower business costs, could be substantially larger, says Todd, who heads research and development at IDEAS, a non-profit policy research institute.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important not to conflate refugees with other undocumented migrants who may have come to Malaysia to look for work,\u201d he says. \u201cFirstly, refugees and asylum seekers are fleeing persecution and secondly, they are a very small number of the total migrant population in the country.\n\u201cWhen refugees are deprived of economic rights, they are marginalised in a whole number of ways. They still need money, so of course, they do find work illegally, but it is not enough in terms of income for them to afford adequate healthcare, quality education and proper housing,\u201d says Todd.\nThe sectors that refugees and asylum seekers are currently employed in depend on what is available to those working illegally, including dirty, dangerous and difficult jobs, the report states. (See Chart 1)\nThe IDEAS study notes that the Pakatan Harapan coalition made two important promises on refugees in its election manifesto for the 14th general election. It pledged to ratify the 1951 Refugee Convention and grant refugees in Malaysia the legal right to work.\nSince coming to power in May last year, the new government has remained committed to supporting refugees, but has not announced a clear timetable for implementing this reform, the report states.\nRefugees in Malaysia have minimal entitlement to public services. Cost of living aid \u2014 Bantuan Sara Hidup \u2014 is confined to citizens. Nor can refugees access the public school system, while some limited education is available through 130 informal community-based learning centres. Healthcare costs are a significant issue for refugees, 50% of whom cannot afford health services, data from the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR shows.\nThe cost of arrest and detention of illegal migrants can range from RM35 to RM75 per person per day and up to RM26 million per year in total, but it is difficult to say how much of this cost is expended on detaining refugees, says the report.\nIn terms of positive outcomes, the most direct economic impact of granting refugees the right to work will be to increase refugees\u2019 incomes. It would also reduce the scope for exploitation of refugees. In addition, their productivity would improve through better job matching and the increased incentive to invest in human capital.\nGranting refugees the right to work would have a positive impact on the wider economy by increasing the labour supply. For Malaysia, specifically, expanding the pool of foreign labour would lower the cost of doing business, the report finds.\nMany costs borne by the employer would not apply to those who employ refugees legally, especially if the government chose not to apply the foreign worker levy on them, says the report.\nTo quantify the benefits of implementing the election promise, the report\u2019s authors undertook an estimate of the potential earnings of refugees should they be allowed to work.\nThis was based on the reasoning that the labour participation rates of refugees would converge with the national average, as would refugees\u2019 wages, for a given level of education.\nThe report also notes that there would be an ongoing \u201cincome penalty\u201d for not being a Malaysian citizen, based on data that there is a 10% increase in wages associated with obtaining citizenship, except in high-skilled occupations. (See Chart 2)\n\u201cWe estimate that granting refugees in Malaysia the legal right to work will increase the total monthly income of all refugees to over RM165 million by 2024,\u201d the report states. (See Table 1)\nTo estimate the GDP impact as a result of refugee spending stimulating activity in the wider economy, the authors assumed that refugee spending habits match those of the bottom 40% of the national population.\nBased on national data on B40 income and consumption, the marginal propensity of this group to consume was derived, then used to calculate the estimated GDP\u00a0 impact.\nThe estimated impact was seen to be an addition of over RM3 billion to the annual GDP through higher spending by 2024. (See Table 2)\nThese positive impacts on the economy would translate into increased government revenues, the report says.\n\u201cWe estimate that if refugees were given the right to work, their tax contribution would increase to over RM50 million each year by 2024,\u201d the report states, basing the figure on indirect taxation through the consumption of goods and services.\n\u201cTo realise these benefits, the government should take forward the practical steps to implement its manifesto commitment to provide refugees with the right to work, on par with locals. Crucially, this should include ensuring that refugees have full job mobility and are not confined to specific industries or locations \u2014 this will ensure that they can make best use of their skills and improve their productivity,\u201d it recommends.\nIn the long term, investment in education for refugees alongside the local population will see substantial dividends for the country.\n\u201cWe estimate that under a scenario where refugees are granted access to education on a par with locals, their contributions to GDP could increase to over RM6.5 billion each year by 2040 with annual contribution in taxes of over RM250 million,\u201d the report forecasts.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n","33":"POLITICAL analyst Dr Sivamurugan Pandian told me recently that someone he knew had texted him that day to say that the Registrar of Societies had asked him to come and collect his letter confirming his position as the president of a new political party.\nApparently, the new party is Indian-based. Siva said he had read that as at April 2017, Malaysia had 62 registered political parties that were listed as active. Many, I believe, are small parties that are actually only seasonally active.\nBut obviously that number is getting bigger as we are hearing of fresh applications, including from former senator Datuk Ezam Mohd Nor who wants to register his Parti Negara.\nWhile Ezam waits, controversial politician Datuk Ibrahim Ali has had his Parti Bumiputra Perkasa Malaysia approved by the RoS.\nI wonder if all this is good for the country. Do we need so many political parties? Most Malaysian parties are race-based, claiming to be the guardians of the communities they say they represent. And we are all too familiar with the divisive politics of race and religion.\nIbrahim\u2019s party \u2014 called Putra for short \u2014 claims to represent, as the official name clearly suggests, the country\u2019s bumiputera population and vows \u201cnot to compromise on issues related to the bumiputeras and Islam\u201d. Of course, we would be very surprised if Ibrahim had it any other way.\nI take the bumiputeras mentioned here to mean the Malays. After all, the Malays are the majority and their votes matter a lot. Obviously, political parties that want to rule the country must win the Malay votes big time. The number of Malay voters is getting bigger while non-Malay voters are dwindling in number.\nAs a result, racial and religious sentiments are constantly being whipped up for political benefits. Expect things to get worse. Umno and PAS are already gleefully at it \u2014 having no qualms about playing up racial and religious issues. When there is no issue, they will create one. Now, we have Putra in the picture.\nPakatan Harapan chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who heads Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, calls it a \u201cgood\u201d move by Putra, saying that it would be better to have 100 Malay parties so that the community could be divided 100 ways. Vintage Mahathir sarcasm.\nBut Ibrahim hit back, opining that it would be good if more Malay parties were formed \u201caccording to need\u201d, Malaysiakini quoted him as saying. \u201cIt would be good if there are 100 Malay parties if that is what the Malays want.\u201d\nA day later, national news agency Bernama ran a story that Selangor Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah was saddened by the Malay disunity. He said the split was bad, especially when there were so many groups claiming to fight for the interests of the Malays. No names were mentioned.\nWhat we have as a result is divisive politics. As a nation, we are drifting apart. What is more with the formation of new parties claiming to champion the rights of the non-Malays. A typical tit-for-tat situation.\nIn a democracy, says Siva, there is space for as many political parties as possible but \u201cto what extent they function and play their roles is questionable\u201d.\nHe says the parties could encourage participation from various groups based on different ideologies and act as checks and balances for one another. But \u201cat the same time, this encourages polarisation. The leaders prioritise themselves instead of the community and their personalities become more prominent than the ideology\u201d.\nPolitical analyst Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani says greater representation is always good for a democracy, although he agrees with Mahathir that more Malay political parties will divide the community.\n\u201cHowever I don\u2019t think this should be viewed as a negative as this means that no single Malay party can dictate the agenda for the entire community,\u201d he observes.\nIn another development, there are reports that the MIC is engaging with leaders from other smaller Indian parties and absorbing them into its fold to strengthen itself. This is a departure from its decades-long stance that it is the one and only party to have the right to represent the Indian community.\nNow, MIC president Tan Sri S A Vigneswaran has gone on record to confirm that the Malaysian Indian United Party will be disbanded and that its founder Tan Sri S Nallakarupan and members will join the MIC. And MIC is also said to be in talks with the Makkal Sakti Party.\nThis, I feel, will make many a Malay extra worried because as the Malays are becoming split and disunited, the Indians are moving in the opposite direction. Umno and PAS will surely milk this issue dry to prove that their pact is indeed for bangsa dan agama. I am surprised that they have not jumped on this already.\nNonetheless, the move by the MIC is practical, considering the predicament that it and the other Indian parties are in now. Siva says it should also accommodate MyPPP and IPF, both of which are Indian-based parties.\n\u201cWhat MIC is doing is good but it must be done wisely to avoid intra-party conflict later, especially during seat allocation and contests for positions within the party,\u201d says Siva.\nIntra-party and inter-party cooperation now will help the parties involved to either merge or focus on political collaboration and protect their ideology at the same time, he adds.\nAsrul, however, feels if the MIC wants to strengthen its position, it must examine whether it is still relevant to the community it claims to represent, in particular with regard to its relationship with PAS and Umno.\nIt is true that PAS and Umno\u2019s racial and religious rhetoric has hurt the feelings of the non-Malays, the Indians included. \u201cAbsorbing Indian leaders from other parties,\u201d says Asrul, \u201cwill make no difference if the community is still sceptical about the MIC and who it represents.\u201d\nAll said and done, the fact remains that for a country of 32 million people or so, we have too many parties wanting to represent the rakyat. But as the analysts say, that is what democracy brings.\n\u00a0\nMohsin Abdullah is a contributing editor at The Edge.

Clearly, just raising the prices gives more avenues for bad people to do more bad things,\" he said.\n\"If you can make RM2.5 million for a forty footer container... that is a huge amount of money... and a lot of people get tempted. It's not just a political will in general to combat corruption, but a will in general,\" he said.\nAnother panellist, Datuk Seri Akhbar Satar, said Malaysia is facing an integrity crisis.\n\"We have to solve the integrity crisis first. When you are corrupted, whatever software you have or system... it will not work,\" said the ex-president of Transparency International Malaysia.\nGiven that the majority of the illicit cigarette consumption is in Sabah and Sarawak and the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, Akhbar said it is high time for the government to form a taskforce and concentrate on these areas.\nIn a separate statement today, British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd\u00a0managing director Erik Stoel said the illicit tobacco trade issue can no longer be ignored by the government.\n\u201cWe have constantly appealed for serious action to be taken. A cross government action plan must be developed and deployed where all key ministries have a role to play. These include the health ministry\u2019s tobacco control sector, as well as the domestic trade and consumer affairs, home affairs and primary industries ministries.\n\"As the legal industry leader, we are very willing to provide resources and to support a cross government effort to curtail this menace \u2013 international experience tells us that a joint collaboration between the private and public sector can work,\u201d he added.\nStoel noted that illicit tobacco trade negatively impacts the government\u2019s revenues, fuels criminal syndicates and erodes Malaysia\u2019s positive reputation as a country for foreign investment.\nHis statement echoes the findings of a recently published report by research and analyst firm Oxford Economics on the broader impact of the illicit tobacco trade in Malaysia. The report highlighted that since this black economy gained a foothold, the country\u2019s gross domestic product, economy, public health agenda, reputation and legal employment opportunities have been undermined.\nMore disturbing is the fact that these criminal syndicates have blatantly been using and fuelling a culture of organised corruption that has entrenched itself across all levels of Malaysian society. This revelation comes at a time where corruption in Malaysia has already reached critical levels.\n\u201cThe findings of the report highlight that this black economy drains the country of more than just vital revenue. It is a threat to the nation\u2019s sovereignty, fuels corruption and erodes the integrity of its people. These criminals will do all they can to ensure that the levels of corruption in Malaysia is kept at an all-time high,\u201d said Stoel.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnfortunately, we are a first-hand witness of how uncontrolled corruption has eroded a legitimate industry. \u00a0In just four years, the industry now comprises a market majority that does not and will not comply to any form of regulation or taxation.\n\"Clearly, this is a low-risk, high-reward activity because these criminal syndicates have no reservations paying off corrupt officials to avoid detection or to evade enforcement,\" he said.\n\u00a0\n","36":"NEW YORK (June 20): The $1 trillion invested by traditional banks globally over the past three years to improve their technology has not yet delivered the revenue growth that had been expected, according to an Accenture report released on Thursday.\nThe consultancy analyzed more than 160 of the largest retail and commercial banks in 21 countries to determine whether those making the most progress on technology were achieving better financial performance.\nIt found that banks that had advanced the most on digital were the most profitable and highly valuable, but that the higher profitability was driven by having reduced costs rather than revenue growth.\nBanks had hoped that by creating better digital products and experiences for customers they would have achieved the same fast user and revenue growth as new tech-savvy competitors or large technology firms, Alan McIntyre, a senior managing director at Accenture and head of its global banking practice, said in an interview.\n\u201cHaving a good digital offering is not enough to move customers,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t change, the industry is going to end up looking more like a utility.\u201d\nThe study comes as incumbent banks continue to dedicate vast amounts of funding to overhaul their old technology systems and offer more digital services to customers.\nBanks are seeking to meet the higher expectations of customers who have grown accustomed to the user-friendly products and services offered by consumer technology companies and new financial services entrants.\nAccenture did not discount investments in technology, but noted that reducing costs was only the first step banks needed to make to become more competitive in the changing landscape.\nThe move to digital is likely to reduce banks\u2019 income from fees, such as those customers pay for advice or transactions, according to the report.\nIt recommends that moving forward banks focus on making more income from taking risks linked with running the balance sheet, such as interest rate and credit, or by creating new revenue streams in areas not in their traditional domain.\n","37":"KUALA LUMPUR (June 20): JT International Bhd (JTI Malaysia), which is part of Japan Tobacco International, is calling for more coordinated action against illegal cigarette trade, noting that the activity is growing at an \"increasingly fast pace in recent months and is reaching uncontrollable levels\".\nThe country's second largest tobacco company by volume said that with Malaysia having the highest illegal cigarette trading levels in the world at 58.9% of the market based on a 2018 Nielsen study, decisive measures are needed to contain contraband trading before the situation deteriorates further.\n\"All indications from recent studies and reports from the market, as well as our observations on the ground, suggest that the situation is not improving and we are projecting that the government will likely miss its revenue collection targets from the industry in 2019,\" JTI Malaysia managing director Cormac O'Rourke said in a statement today.\n\"There is a growing concern that contraband cigarette trading is gaining momentum in recent months,\" he added.\nO'Rourke noted that while affordability of legal cigarettes has led to the current situation, the focus must now be on enforcement efforts if the country is to get to grips with this spiralling problem.\n\"While the government has passed laws in recent months that increases the penalties against contraband trading, this must be accompanied by strong action and enforcement at ground level if the government is to have any success in stemming the tide of 12 billion sticks of illegal cigarettes flooding into the market,\" he said.\nJTI Malaysia reiterated its earlier calls that the government implement the following measures:\nAn excise tax moratorium for the next three years to avoid any further price shocks leading to more smokers switching to illegal cigarettes and to also allow for enforcement actions to take hold\nA ban on transhipment for cigarettes at entry points in Malaysia, which has been manipulated to bring illegal cigarettes into the country. There should also only be a single point of entry for any importation of cigarettes into Malaysia, and\nEstablishment of an independent body to lead a special taskforce on addressing illegal cigarette sales comprising multiple relevant government agencies including industry representatives to ensure a comprehensive approach.\nOn its part, O'Rourke said JTI Malaysia is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to discuss further with the government on its proposals.\n","38":"PUTRAJAYA (June 20): The corruption trial of Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, wife of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, over the Sarawak solar project cases will be heard in the High Court.\nThis follows Rosmah\u2019s decision to withdraw her appeal today in the Court of Appeal against the Kuala Lumpur High Court decision of March 15 this year allowing the prosecution to transfer her case from the Sessions Court to the High Court.\nRosmah's counsel Datuk Jagjit Singh informed a three-member bench led by Justice Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli that the defence is withdrawing the appeal in the light of a High Court decision of May 30.\nOn that date, High Court judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan allowed a prosecution application to jointly try Rosmah and Rizal Mansor, a former special officer to Najib, at the High Court pertaining to their corruption charges over the solar project and set 32 days for trial beginning Feb 3 next year.\nMohamed Zaini had also ordered for Rosmah\u2019s money-laundering charges, involving more than RM7 million, to be heard separately and fixed May 11 for the trial.\nToday, DPP Mohd Farizul Hassan Bakri did not object to the withdrawal of the appeal.\nJustice Abdul Rahman, who sat with Justices Datuk Kamardin Hashim and Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal, then struck off the appeal.\nRosmah, 67, was not present in court today.\nShe pleaded not guilty in the Sessions Court on Nov 15 last year to two counts of soliciting RM187.5 million and receiving RM1.5 million for projects to provide solar energy to 369 rural schools in Sarawak.\nRizal, 46, claimed trial on that same day to four counts of soliciting and accepting bribes for himself and Rosmah, amounting to RM5.5 million, over the same project.\nOn Oct 4 last year, Rosmah also pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of money laundering amounting to RM7,097,750 and five charges of failing to declare her income to the Inland Revenue Board.\n","39":"NIEUWEGEIN, Netherlands (June 20): Three Russians and a Ukrainian will face murder charges for the deaths of 298 people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 that was shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014, the international investigative team said on Wednesday.\nThe suspects are likely to be tried in absentia in proceedings set to start in the Netherlands next March. Dutch authorities said Russia has not cooperated with the inquiry and is not expected to surrender defendants.\n\u201cThese suspects are seen to have played an important role in the death of 298 innocent civilians,\u201d Dutch Chief Prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said. \u201cAlthough they did not push the button themselves, we suspect them of close cooperation to get the (missile launcher) where it was, with the aim to shoot down an airplane.\u201d\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry denied that it had not cooperated while saying on Wednesday the investigation was intended to damage Moscow\u2019s reputation.\n\u201cOnce again, absolutely groundless accusations are being made against the Russian side, aimed at discrediting the Russian Federation in the eyes of the international community,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nDutch Justice Minister Ferdinand Grapperhaus said in a letter to parliament the Netherlands had taken unspecified \u201cdiplomatic steps\u201d against Moscow for failing to fully comply with legal requests or providing incorrect information.\nMH17 was shot out of the sky on July 17, 2014, over territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine as it was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Everyone aboard died.\nThe Dutch-led international team tasked with assigning criminal responsibility for the plane\u2019s destruction named the four suspects as Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin, and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko. It said international arrest warrants for the four had been issued.\nGirkin, 48, a vocal and battle-hardened Russian nationalist, is believed to live in Moscow where he makes regular public appearances. He is a commentator on Russian and foreign affairs via his own website and YouTube channel.\n\u201cThe rebels did not shoot down the Boeing,\u201d Girkin told Reuters on Wednesday without elaborating.\nUkrainian authorities said they would try to detain Kharchenko, who is believed to be on their territory.\n\u201cThe Russian Federation must now cooperate fully with the prosecution and provide any assistance it requests,\u201d British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said. There were 10 Britons on the flight.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Russia in a statement to \u201censure that any indicted individuals currently in Russia face justice.\u201d\nRUSSIAN MISSILE\nMost of the passengers were Dutch. The joint investigation team formed by Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine found that the plane was downed by a Russian missile.\nLast year Russian President Vladimir Putin called MH17\u2019s downing a \u201cterrible tragedy\u201d but said Moscow was not to blame and there were other explanations for what happened.\nAsked if she expected the suspects to attend the trial, Silene Fredriksz, whose son Bryce was on the plane, said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. But I don\u2019t care. I just want the truth, and this is the truth.\u201d\nThe investigation team said Girkin was a former Russian FSB security service colonel who served as minister of defence of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine in the summer of 2014.\nIt said Dubinsky was head of the military intelligence agency of DNR, while Pulatov headed a second department of the agency. Kharchenko was head of a reconnaissance battalion for the second department, it said.\nProsecutors have said the missile system that brought down the airliner came from the Russian 53rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade, based in the western Russian city of Kursk.\n","40":"\uff08\u5409\u9686\u576120\u65e5\u8baf\uff09\u8054\u5408\u732e\u8d2d\u65b9\u4ee5\u6bcf\u80a12.33\u4ee4\u5409\uff0c\u8d2d\u5165\u4e49\u5229\uff08Yee Lee Corp Bhd\uff09\u768415\u4e075500\u80a1\u3002\n\u8054\u5408\u732e\u8d2d\u65b9\u5305\u62ec\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u57fa\u91d1Dymon Asia Private Equity\uff08\u4e1c\u5357\u4e9a\uff09Fund II\u79c1\u4eba\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u3001\u4e49\u5229\u521b\u529e\u4eba\u62ff\u7763\u6797\u56fd\u748b\u4e0e\u5bb6\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caLangit Makmur\u79c1\u4eba\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4e49\u5229\u4eca\u65e5\u5411\u5927\u9a6c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u62a5\u5907\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80a1\u7968\u662f\u5728\u6628\u65e5\uff0819\u65e5\uff09\u4e70\u5165\u7684\u3002\n\u672c\u67084\u65e5\uff0c\u8be5\u96c6\u56e2\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u732e\u8d2d\u65b9\u5df2\u5c06\u63a5\u53d7\u732e\u8d2d\u7684\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u671f\u5ef6\u957f\u81f3\u4eca\u5e746\u670821\u65e5\uff0c\u539f\u5b9a\u622a\u6b62\u65e5\u662f6\u67087\u65e5\u3002\u968f\u540e\u53c8\u5ef6\u957f\u81f37\u67083\u65e5\u3002\n\u622a\u81f36\u67083\u65e5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u732e\u8d2d\u65b9\u5df2\u7ecf\u7d2f\u79ef1\u4ebf3403\u4e07\u80a1\uff0c\u76f8\u7b49\u4e8e69.95%\u80a1\u6743\u3002\n\u4e49\u5229\u8fd8\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u5df2\u67091269\u4e07\u80a1\u62166.62%\u80a1\u6743\u63a5\u53d7\u732e\u8d2d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u6838\u5b9e\u3002\n\u8054\u5408\u732e\u8d2d\u65b9\u4e8e\u4eca\u5e744\u670826\u65e5\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee5\u73b0\u91d1\u6bcf\u80a12.33\u4ee4\u5409\u6536\u8d2d\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c1a\u672a\u6301\u6709\u76847969\u4e07\u80a1\u621641.59%\u80a1\u6743\u3002\n\u8fd9\u6bd4\u8be5\u80a1\u4e8e4\u670825\u65e5\u76841.94\u4ee4\u5409\u95ed\u5e02\u4ef7\uff0c\u6ea2\u4ef739\u4ed9\u621620.1%\u3002\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u987e\u95ee\u827e\u82ac\u9ec4\u6c0f\u6295\u8d44\u94f6\u884c\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u8be5\u732e\u8d2d\u201c\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4f46\u5408\u7406\u201d\u3002\n\u8be5\u6295\u884c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u6bd4\u4e49\u5229\u76843.42\u81f33.93\u4ee4\u5409\u9884\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\u4ef7\uff0c\u6298\u4ef731.87%\u81f340.71%\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u6295\u884c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u732e\u8d2d\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u622a\u81f3\u4eca\u5e743\u6708\u4efd\u768412\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\uff0c\u4e49\u5229\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6295\u6de1\u9759\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u6708\u4ea4\u6613\u91cf\u5360\u603b\u80a1\u7968\u91cf\u76840.89%\u3002\n\u622a\u81f33\u65f655\u5206\uff0c\u4e49\u5229\u62a52.33\u4ee4\u5409\uff0c\u65e0\u8d77\u843d\uff0c\u4ea4\u6295\u91cf\u670937\u4e071900\u80a1\u3002\n\u00a0\n\uff08\u7f16\u8bd1\uff1a\u9648\u6167\u73ca\uff09\n","41":"THE subdued first-quarter earnings of Malaysian banks portend a trend of weakening profitability, analysts say.\nAs difficult as it was for lenders to grow core earnings in 1Q2019, it will be even tougher to do so in the remaining quarters of the year, given uncertainties from deteriorating US-China relations and last month\u2019s cut in the overnight policy rate (OPR) by Bank Negara Malaysia as well as competitive funding costs, which will further weigh on margins. Weaker capital markets may also lead to softer non-interest incomes for the banks.\n\u201cWe believe banks operating in the Malaysian market will see visible margin compression, accompanied by slower loan growth and higher non-interest income volatility for the rest of 2019. Asset quality will likely hold, despite downward pressure,\u201d S&P Global Ratings says in a May 31 report.\nThe January-to-March period saw all eight domestic banking groups, except Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, register a year-on-year decline in net interest margin (NIM), an indicator of profitability.\nAlliance Bank saw a seven-basis point (bp) increase in NIM to 2.57%, the highest margin among the eight banking groups, thanks to its strong focus on higher risk-adjusted return loans such as personal and small and medium enterprise loans.\nAffin Bank Bhd experienced the biggest dip in margin (-37 bps to 1.61%), followed by AMMB Holdings Bhd (-26 bps to 1.78%).\nNIMs fell mainly because of higher funding costs, fuelled by stronger accumulation of fixed deposits and weaker current account and savings account deposits. It should also be noted that there was a 25 bps hike in the OPR in the same quarter a year ago.\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, five of the eight banks saw a decline in NIM. The only three that saw improvement were CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (three bps to 2.48%), Public Bank Bhd (one bp to 2.19%) and Alliance Bank (one bp to 2.57%).\n\u201cHowever, these improvements are either unsustainable or masked by their overseas operations\u2019 NIM recovery (in the case of Indonesia for CIMB),\u201d opines S&P Global. S&P Global tracks the five big banks, namely Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), CIMB, Public Bank, RHB Bank Bhd and AMMB.\nGiven Bank Negara\u2019s 25 bps cut in the OPR last month, there will continue to be downside pressure on NIM.\n\u201c[The cut] means there will be further downside ahead until end-2019, of which we typically assume a six-to-nine-month lag for the repricing of these banks\u2019 assets and liabilities. Continuous tight liquidity in the market \u2014 amid persistent deposit competition \u2014 clearly does not help and is increasing the cost of funding. Heightened capital market volatility amid escalating trade tensions between the US and China \u2014 while not a risk factor unique to Malaysia \u2014 is dampening the outlook for local banks\u2019 non-interest revenues,\u201d says S&P Global credit analyst Nancy Duan.\n\u201cAll these factors contribute to our negative view on Malaysian banks\u2019 profitability trend this year \u2014 especially when we believe there is limited room for further cost-cutting. All in all, we are likely to see a disappointing 2019 in terms of bottom-line earnings.\u201d\nLoans are not growing as robustly either. Bank Negara\u2019s latest monthly banking data shows that the industry\u2019s loan growth eased in April for the fourth consecutive month, to 4.5% y-o-y from 4.9% in March.\nHowever, given that there was positive growth that month in loan applications and approvals, there is optimism that things could pick up in 2Q and 3Q. Hence, analysts are sticking to their full-year loan growth projections of about 5% for the year.\nMeanwhile, all eyes will continue to be on banks\u2019 asset quality, which has stayed resilient so far despite the pressures. The industry\u2019s gross impaired loan (GIL) ratio stood at 1.51% as at end-April, having inched up five bps from end-March.\nAffin Bank\u2019s asset quality, in particular, will be watched. Its GIL ratio inched up six bps q-o-q to 3.31%, far higher than the industry average, partly due to two problematic accounts. The bank has told analysts that it expects to resolve the two accounts \u2014 one in the oil and gas sector and the other in property \u2014 by year end.\nMost of the banks reported subdued first-quarter core earnings, albeit within analysts\u2019 consensus forecasts.\nBIMB Holdings Bhd, which owns Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, was the only financial institution that surpassed expectations. Its 1QFY2019 net profit stood at RM202.5 million, up 17.6% y-o-y and 25.5% q-o-q, boosted by strong takaful income, net financing income and benign loan loss provisions (LLPs).\nMaybank Investment Bank Research deems the banking sector to have performed below expectations in the first quarter. The total core net profit of the banks under its coverage fell 0.9% y-o-y and 7.3% q-o-q.\n\u201cWe put the banks through quite a fair bit of earnings downgrades,\u201d it says in a June 4 report. It now expects banks\u2019 core earnings to grow a smaller 3.8% this year compared with earlier expectations of 6.1%. Last year, earnings grew 7.1%.\nMaybank\u2019s 1QFY2019 net profit, at RM1.81 billion \u2014 down 3.3% y-o-y and 22.2% q-o-q \u2014 came in below expectations, making up just 22% of consensus estimates for the full year.\nThis was mainly because of higher LLPs due to a top-up in provisioning for its exposure to financially distressed Singapore water treatment firm Hyflux. The bank also reported lower net interest and non-interest incomes.\n\u201cThe bank did not disclose the quantum of the additional provision for Hyflux, but we think that this could form the bulk of the total provision of RM596.4 million for its group corporate banking and global markets in 1Q2019,\u201d says CIMB-CGS Research.\nThe research house notes that Maybank is, nevertheless, sticking to its guidance of a credit charge-off rate of 40 bps for FY2019, despite the 48 bps in 1QFY2019, suggesting that the bank is expecting lower average LLP per quarter in the next three quarters.\nMaybank\u2019s exposure to Hyflux stands at about S$602.4 million (RM1.83 billion), which it is working to recover.\n\u201cWe understand that Maybank is working with all the parties involved for the recovery of the amount owed by Hyflux. However, the bank has not given any indication of the expected completion timeline for the process nor the possible outcome,\u201d says CIMB-CGS Research.\nMaybank has guided for a potential negative impact of one bp on its NIM this year from the OPR cut. RHB Bank is maintaining its return on equity target of 10.5% for the year, but has guided analysts that it expects a further five bps compression in NIM, from an earlier guidance of three to five bps.\nMost analysts continue to have a \u201cneutral\u201d call on the banking sector.\n\u201cWe continue to rate Malaysian banks at \u2018neutral\u2019, given the concerns over margin erosion and an expected uptick in credit costs. On a positive note, the sector\u2019s dividend yield is attractive at a projected 4% for 2019, \u201d says CIMB-CGS Research.\nThe stocks with the most \u201cbuy\u201d calls by analysts currently include RHB, CIMB, Alliance Bank and Maybank. The Financial Services Index on Bursa Malaysia has shed 2.7% year to date, similar to the fall in the key benchmark index FBM KLCI as at last Thursday.\n\u00a0\n","42":"JUST last week, Morgan Stanley said that a recession could begin as soon as nine months\u2019 time if US President Donald Trump pushes to impose a 25% tariff on an additional US$300 billion of Chinese exports, and if China retaliates with its own countermeasures.\nThis does not bode well for Malaysian corporations, some of which have already experienced a deterioration in earnings as a result of the Sino-US conflict.\nDespite a recent report by Japanese bank Nomura that Malaysia has been identified as the fourth biggest beneficiary of trade diversion after Vietnam, Taiwan and Chile, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said Malaysia wants the trade war to end.\n\u201cMalaysia hopes that the trade war will end because, eventually, there will be no winners, only losers. All parties should instead enhance cooperation at the regional and global levels to allow the global economy to grow sustainably,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday.\n\u201cThe ongoing trade war and its effect of slowing global trade has certainly impacted the export sectors \u2014 mainly in technology, the electrical and electronics exports, oil and gas, plantations and also logistics,\u201d Fortress Capital Asset Management (M) Sdn Bhd investment adviser and director Geoffrey Ng tells The Edge.\nThus, he does not see the earnings of corporations that have been impacted by the trade conflict improving anytime soon.\n\u201cWith limited visibility of a resolution to what looks like a worsening trade negotiation, we expect the next couple of quarters to reflect even more subdued corporate earnings from sectors that are dependent on such trade flows for primary and intermediate products and services from China.\n\u201cThat said, we are also on the lookout for companies and sectors that may benefit from the medium-to-longer term adjustment of supply-chain activity from China,\u201d Ng adds.\nOptimistic about a better 2H?\nWith the performance of stocks depending on corporate earnings, among others, foreign selling on the local bourse thus far is indicative of the expectations of companies\u2019 performance.\nIn its 1Q2019 results review note, Kenanga Research says that year to date (up to March 2019), total foreign outflow of RM1.36 billion is a telltale sign of the softer confidence in the local market.\n\u201cStill, we are optimistic about a better second half of 2019, with our strategists\u2019 view that the weakness in sentiment could be nearing its end.\n\u201cThis is premised on the potential bottoming of local benchmark indices, potentially backed by healthy and sustainable oil prices. On another note, the introduction of the T+2 settlement cycle for the securities market could lead to a rise in transaction volumes, and hence, trading participation,\u201d the firm says.\nIt is worth noting that HSBC Global Research recently upgraded its rating on Malaysia to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cunderweight\u201d.\n\u201cMSCI Malaysia was among the worst-performing markets in Asean year to date, down 5.9%. However, we think the economy looks resilient, with domestic demand strong and manufacturing growth holding up.\n\u201cLow earnings growth is a concern but we see limited further downside. Valuations, while not as attractive as in other markets in the region, are not particularly expensive. The market has strong defensive qualities, which should reduce downside risks if trade tensions escalate,\u201d the firm adds.\nThe FBM KLCI closed at 1,649.33 points last Friday, down 2.4% year to date. The market is currently trading at 16.7 times PER, relatively higher compared to its regional peers such as the Singapore Straits Times Index at 12.49 times, the Stock Exchange of Thailand SET Index at 15.37 times, the Jakarta Composite Index at 15.06 times and the Ho Chi Minh Stock Index at 16.15 times.\n\u00a0\n"}}
